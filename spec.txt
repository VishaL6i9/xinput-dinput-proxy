## Updated Spec Plan (Performance‑Oriented) - 2026 Roadmap for Windows 11

### Objective
Develop a high-performance Windows 11 application in **C++** that translates controller input between **XInput ↔ DirectInput** in real time. Implement virtual device emulation using user-mode solutions leveraging Windows 11's Input Injection API and GameInput API to avoid kernel-mode driver requirements. Include a **performance-optimized text‑based dashboard** using modern TUI library.

### Core Features
- **High-Performance Input Capture**
  - Poll Xbox controllers via **XInput** with optimized polling frequency (1000Hz+ if possible).
  - Poll DualSense/other controllers via **Windows GameInput API** or **HID API** (Windows.Devices.HumanInterfaceDevice).
  - Maintain sub‑millisecond polling loop using **QueryPerformanceCounter/QueryPerformanceFrequency** for precise timing.

- **Efficient Translation Layer**
  - Map button/axis states between XInput and DirectInput layouts with minimal processing overhead.
  - Handle trigger differences (combined vs separate) with optimized algorithms.
  - Translate rumble feedback where possible with low-latency processing.

- **Virtual Device Emulation** *(Using ViGEmBus for optimal performance)*
  - Utilize **ViGEmBus** for creating virtual Xbox/DS4 controllers (optimal low-latency performance).
  - Integrate **HidHide** (successor to HIDGuardian) to mask physical devices.
  - Implement proper device enumeration and filtering.
  - Handle multiple controller instances with unique identification.

- **Performance-Optimized Text‑Based Dashboard**
  - Built with **FTXUI** (modern C++ TUI library) for efficient rendering.
  - Panels for:
    - Connected controllers with real-time status
    - Emulated device identity
    - Current mappings with live feedback
    - Latency measurements and performance metrics
  - Configurable profiles via text menus/config files with hot-swapping capability.

### Windows 11 Performance Optimization Strategies

**High Priority Optimizations:**
- **Thread Priority**: Use THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST or THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL for input polling threads
- **Timer Precision**: Use QueryPerformanceCounter/QueryPerformanceFrequency instead of multimedia timers for highest precision
- **Memory Allocation**: Minimize dynamic allocations in the input processing loop; use pre-allocated buffers
- **CPU Affinity**: Pin critical threads to specific CPU cores to reduce context switching overhead

**Medium Priority Optimizations:**
- **Power Profile**: Detect and recommend high-performance power plan for optimal input handling
- **Compiler Optimizations**: Use profile-guided optimization (PGO) and link-time code generation (LTCG)
- **Cache Efficiency**: Optimize data structures for cache-friendly access patterns
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple input events in batches to reduce system call overhead

**Low Priority Optimizations:**
- **NUMA Awareness**: On multi-socket systems, bind threads to appropriate NUMA nodes
- **Interrupt Moderation**: Configure network and storage devices to reduce interrupt interference
- **System Tracing**: Use Windows Performance Toolkit to identify bottlenecks

### Updated Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**High Priority Risks:**
- **ViGEmBus Availability**: ViGEmBus was retired in 2023. Mitigation: Use community forks or alternative kernel-mode solutions.
- **Driver Signing Requirements**: Windows 11 requires signed kernel drivers. Mitigation: Use properly signed ViGEmBus distribution.
- **Game Compatibility**: Some games may have issues with emulated devices. Mitigation: Extensive testing with popular titles and fallback options.

**Medium Priority Risks:**
- **Windows Updates**: Future Windows updates may affect Input Injection API. Mitigation: Regular testing and maintain alternative approaches.
- **Power Management**: Windows 11 power saving features may impact polling precision. Mitigation: Implement power profile detection and recommendations.
- **Multi-Threading Complexity**: Managing multiple high-priority threads safely. Mitigation: Use lock-free queues and atomic operations where possible.

**Low Priority Risks:**
- **App Store Requirements**: If distributed through Microsoft Store, additional requirements may apply. Mitigation: Design with Store compliance in mind from the start.
